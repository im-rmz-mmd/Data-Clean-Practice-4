My New Practice Project: Data Cleaning and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib! 
This project marks my first experience combining Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Working with a raw dataset and turning it into clean, understandable information was a highly rewarding experience packed with valuable lessons! 

Project Steps:

Data Cleaning:

Removed unnecessary columns like "Email" and "Address."

Eliminated duplicate data to ensure accurate analysis.

Dropped rows with missing values.

Renamed column headers for better readability.

Data Analysis:

Explored data distributions such as gender counts, average income by country, and various job roles.

Visualization with Matplotlib:

Gender Distribution:
A simple pie chart was created to show the percentage of male and female data entries.

51.1% Women

48.9% Men

Income by Gender:
Another pie chart illustrating which gender earns the highest income.

51.9% Women

48.9% Men

Income by Country:
A line chart displaying high-income countries was created with the following styling:

linestyle: dashed

marker: ★

Income by Job Roles:
Another line chart ranking jobs from the lowest to the highest income.

linestyle: dotted

marker: D

Income by Companies:
The final line chart highlighted the most profitable companies.

linestyle: solid

marker: D

Why Is This Project Important?

This project taught me several key lessons:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning: Before any analysis, datasets must be clean and standardized. For example, handling null values is critical.
2️⃣ Effective Visualization: Simple yet precise charts make data far easier to understand.
